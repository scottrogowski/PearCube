	    Hi Michaela,
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    I understand that you are looking for an inexpensive portable scanner that is not very complicated. After researching the options, we think we found one
	    that might work for you. Click below to see details</p>

    <p>
    If you buy this scanner, be sure to let me know how it goes. If it doesnâ€™t work out for you, I would be happy to help you return it and find you one that works.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks!</p>
