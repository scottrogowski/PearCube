	    I understand that you are looking for an inexpensive portable photo scanner that is not very complicated. After researching the options, I think I found one
	    that might work for you. Click below to see details</p>

    <p>
    If you buy this scanner, be sure to let me know how it goes. If it doesnâ€™t work out for you, I would be happy to help you return it and find you one that works.
